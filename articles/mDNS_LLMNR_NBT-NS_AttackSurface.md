# The Name Resolution Trinity: mDNS, LLMNR & NBT-NS Attack Surface

## How legacy protocols create a perfect storm for credential theft and network compromise

---

## Executive Summary

The combination of mDNS, LLMNR, and NBT-NS creates a devastating attack surface that allows adversaries to poison name resolution, capture credentials, and establish persistence in enterprise networks. Recent threat intelligence shows these protocols are increasingly targeted in sophisticated attack campaigns, with attackers leveraging automated tools to exploit all three protocols simultaneously.

This trinity of name resolution protocols represents one of the most overlooked yet critical security vulnerabilities in modern enterprise networks. While organizations focus on perimeter security and advanced persistent threats, attackers are quietly exploiting these foundational network protocols to gain initial access and escalate privileges.

**Key Findings:**
- 90% of Windows networks have LLMNR enabled by default
- Average time to capture credentials: 15 minutes
- 85% success rate in penetration testing scenarios
- Combined protocols create cross-platform attack vectors

---

## The Trinity Attack Chain

### Step 1: DNS Resolution Fails
A user attempts to access a network resource using a hostname that cannot be resolved through the primary DNS server. This could be due to:
- Typos in server names (\\pintserver instead of \\printserver)
- Temporary DNS server unavailability
- Misconfigured DNS entries
- New devices joining the network

### Step 2: Fallback Protocols Activate
When DNS resolution fails, operating systems automatically fall back to alternative name resolution methods:
- **Windows systems** attempt LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution)
- **Legacy Windows systems** use NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service)
- **Apple/Linux systems** and modern Windows use mDNS (Multicast DNS)

### Step 3: Responder Tool Intercepts
Attackers deploy tools like Responder, which listens for these multicast queries and responds faster than legitimate services. The tool simultaneously monitors:
- UDP port 5355 (LLMNR)
- UDP port 137 (NBT-NS)
- UDP port 5353 (mDNS)

### Step 4: Credentials Captured
When the victim's system receives the malicious response, it attempts to authenticate to the attacker's fake server, sending:
- NTLM hashes
- Kerberos tickets
- Clear-text credentials (in some configurations)

---

## Protocol-Specific Attack Vectors

### LLMNR (Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution)
**Protocol:** UDP 5355
**Target:** Windows Vista and later
**Attack Method:** Multicast query poisoning

LLMNR was designed to provide name resolution in scenarios where DNS is not available. However, it operates on the assumption that all devices on the local network are trustworthy. Any device on the network can respond to LLMNR queries, letting them impersonate another device.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**
- User mistypes a UNC path (\\printsrv instead of \\printserver)
- Application attempts to connect to a non-existent service
- Mobile devices searching for network resources

### NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Service)
**Protocol:** UDP 137
**Target:** All Windows versions (legacy support)
**Attack Method:** NetBIOS name poisoning

NBT-NS provides backward compatibility for legacy Windows applications that rely on NetBIOS names. Despite being deprecated, it remains enabled by default on most Windows systems.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**
- Legacy applications using NetBIOS names
- Windows file sharing in mixed environments
- Print services using NetBIOS resolution

### mDNS (Multicast DNS)
**Protocol:** UDP 5353
**Target:** Apple devices, Linux systems, modern Windows
**Attack Method:** Multicast query spoofing

mDNS enables zero-configuration networking, allowing devices to automatically discover services without manual configuration. It's particularly prevalent in environments with Apple devices and IoT systems.

**Common Attack Scenarios:**
- AirPrint service discovery
- File sharing between Apple devices
- IoT device communication
- Windows 10+ systems with mDNS enabled

---

## Real-World Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Typo That Compromised the Network
**Timeline:** 3 minutes from typo to credential capture

A marketing manager attempts to access the print server by typing `\\pintserver` instead of `\\printserver`. The Windows system cannot resolve the hostname through DNS and broadcasts an LLMNR query. An attacker running Responder immediately responds, claiming to be the print server. The victim's system attempts to authenticate, sending their NTLM hash. The attacker captures the hash and begins offline cracking.

**Impact:** Domain user credentials compromised, lateral movement initiated

### Scenario 2: The Mobile Device Trap
**Timeline:** 5 minutes from network connection to domain compromise

An executive's iPhone connects to the corporate WiFi network and automatically searches for AirPrint services using mDNS. An attacker positioned on the network responds to the mDNS query, presenting a malicious print service. When the device attempts to authenticate, the attacker captures the user's domain credentials through the corporate wireless authentication.

**Impact:** Executive-level access compromised, sensitive data exposure

### Scenario 3: The Legacy Application Vulnerability
**Timeline:** 2 minutes from application startup to credential theft

A legacy manufacturing application uses NetBIOS names to connect to a database server. The application attempts to resolve the server name through NBT-NS. An attacker poisons the response, directing the application to connect to a malicious SMB server. The application authenticates using the service account credentials, which are captured and used for privilege escalation.

**Impact:** Service account compromise, manufacturing system access

## The Responder Tool: Automated Trinity Exploitation

Responder is a powerful tool that simultaneously exploits all three protocols, making it the weapon of choice for attackers. The tool operates by:

1. **Listening** for LLMNR, NBT-NS, and mDNS queries
2. **Responding** faster than legitimate services
3. **Presenting** fake services (SMB, HTTP, FTP, etc.)
4. **Capturing** authentication attempts
5. **Logging** credentials for offline cracking

**Key Features:**
- Automatic protocol detection
- Built-in SMB, HTTP, and FTP servers
- NTLM hash capture and relay
- Integration with password cracking tools
- Stealth mode to avoid detection

---

## Current Threat Landscape

### Attack Frequency and Success Rates
Recent penetration testing data reveals alarming statistics about name resolution attacks:

- **90% of Windows networks** have LLMNR enabled by default
- **75% of mixed environments** have all three protocols active
- **85% success rate** in capturing credentials during penetration tests
- **15 minutes average** time to capture first credential
- **60% of attacks** lead to domain admin escalation within 24 hours

### Threat Actor Adoption
Both nation-state actors and cybercriminal groups are increasingly incorporating name resolution attacks into their playbooks:

- **APT groups** use these techniques for initial access and persistence
- **Ransomware operators** leverage credential theft for lateral movement
- **Insider threats** exploit these protocols for privilege escalation
- **Penetration testers** report consistent success across all client environments

### Industry Impact
Healthcare, financial services, and manufacturing sectors are particularly vulnerable due to:
- Legacy system dependencies
- Mixed operating system environments
- High network device density

        # Log to SIEM
        log_attack(addr, "LLMNR", data)
```

---

## Alternative Solutions and Compensating Controls

### DNS Suffix Configuration
Proper DNS suffix configuration can eliminate many name resolution failures that trigger fallback protocols:

**Windows Domain Configuration:**
```
Primary DNS Suffix: company.local
DNS Suffix Search List: 
  - company.local
  - corp.company.local
  - servers.company.local
```

**DHCP Option 015 (DNS Domain Name):**
```
Option 015: company.local
```

### Host File Management
For critical systems, centralized host file management can provide reliable name resolution:

**PowerShell Host File Update:**
```powershell
$hostfile = "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
$entries = @(
    "192.168.1.100 printserver",
    "192.168.1.101 fileserver",
    "192.168.1.102 dbserver"
)
Add-Content -Path $hostfile -Value $entries
```

### Zero Trust Architecture
Implementing zero trust principles can mitigate the impact of name resolution attacks:

- **Identity Verification:** Require authentication for all network access
- **Device Validation:** Verify device compliance before network access
- **Encryption:** Encrypt all network communications
- **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of all network activities
